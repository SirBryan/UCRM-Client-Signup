# UCRM Client Signup
A [UCRM plugin](https://github.com/Ubiquiti-App/UCRM-plugins) that provides a frontend form for clients to signup.

_Developed by [Charuwts, LLC](https://charuwts.com)_

When installed onto UCRM the plugin public URL will display a form that anyone can enter valid info into to create a client.

#### *_Not ready for Production._*

_Primarily because there hasn't been many unit tests. So technically if you want to use it in production it will work. But as a best practice in coding and for the sake maintainability, "Programmatically Testing" the code is strongly recommended. So this is a disclaimer in light of that having not been done yet._


## Instructions

This plugin does not use "Execution Period" or "Execute Manually". It is designed to use the plugin public URL to post from a form and create a new Client.

There are optional params for a custom Logo, Title, Form Description and Completion Text.

- *Form Title:* Displayed below logo before form description
- *Logo URL:* Displayed above form. Max width 400px
- *Form Description:* Displayed below logo before the form. (Can contain HTML)
- *Completion Text:* Text shown upon signup completion. (Text Only) - Defaults To: Thank you for signing up! You will receive an invitation to access your account upon approval.

## Simplified release

This is a simplified release of a more feature rich plugin planned for creating services for the client as well and automatically charging for invoices that are due using Stripe. More gateway integrations to come!
