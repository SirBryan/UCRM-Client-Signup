# UCRM Client Signup
A [UCRM plugin](https://github.com/Ubiquiti-App/UCRM-plugins) that provides a frontend form for clients to signup.

_Developed by [Charuwts, LLC](https://charuwts.com)_

When installed onto UCRM the plugin public URL will display a form that anyone can enter valid info into to create a client.

## Simplified release

This is a simplified release of a more feature rich plugin planned for subscribing clients using the signup process via Stripe. Which will include charging the client immediately and creating their service in UCRM. Or even having an installation fee and delay creation of the service via a Stripe Subscription trial period, that once ended, creates the UCRM service.

For more functionality, share your support by voting on these feature requests on the UCRM forum. And by making your interest known on the discussion thread.
